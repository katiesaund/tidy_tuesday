# tidy_tuesday
A weekly data project in R from the R4DS online learning community

My data visualization and analyses of the datasets are organized by week. 

Rules for #tidytuesday: 
* Create and save an image of a plot from R
* Save the code used to recreate your plot (include data tidy steps!)
* Submit the plot and code on Twitter
* Use the #TidyTuesday hashtag (you can also tag me @thomas_mock)
* Browse other submissions and like/comment on their work!
